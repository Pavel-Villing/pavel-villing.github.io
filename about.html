        <p>
          I am a Computer Science Student at Simon Fraser University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree. As a motivated third year student with a background in coding, I am interested in introductory developer roles to grow my technical skills. Iâ€™m driven by the challenge of turning creative ideas into functional, user-friendly tools.

      <p>
        I enjoy working across the full stack. I am interested in both front end and back end roles, from designing clean front-end interfaces with HTML/CSS to building efficient back-end logic in C++ or Python. I have applied these languages in hands-on projects that helped me strengthen my understanding of memory management, and building user-focused tools.

      <p>
        I have always had a passion for working with a team to bring ideas to life, through creative and practical software development. I take pride in building impactful software with others. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can brainstorm, iterate, and build with others. Through university projects and team sports, I've learned the value of clear communication and giving/receiving feedback to reach shared goals.

      <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy playing soccer, going to the gym, and working on cars - especially detailing. These hobbies reflect my attention to detail, collabrative mindset, and hands-on approach to problem-solving, all of which I carry into my work as a developer.
