        I am interested in both front end and back end development. Both in roles such as working with user interface, as well as backend development and algorithm design.

      <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy playing soccer, going to the gym, and working on cars - especially detailing. These hobbies reflect my attention to detail, discipline, and hands-on approach to problem-solving, all of which I carry into my work as a developer.
